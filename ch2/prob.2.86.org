This would involve modifying the original polar and rectangular packages to use
the generic add, sub, mul, div operations as well as defining new generic
operations sine and cosine for each available type.

I've opted out of this because it is a trivial exercise that merely requires
bulk modifications without providing much additional knowledge of type
dispatch.
